If this looks good I will:
1. Provide the two exact image files you need to upload (the banner + the illustration) as download links here.  
2. Give the **exact 3-step** upload checklist one more time so you can finish in 2 minutes.

Tell me: **“Yes upload files”** and I’ll give the downloads and the final 2-minute checklist.
